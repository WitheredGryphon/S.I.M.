Student Information Management System

To access the student panel you have to manually log in to PHPMyAdmin's MySQL and create a new user
with the following fields:

Username
Password
AccountType

The AccountType must be set to either admin or student. Currently there is nothing for admin, however
the Student Panel is a work in progress that you can access if you set AccountType to student.
