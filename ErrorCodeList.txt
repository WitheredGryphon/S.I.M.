              correct. If the issue persists, confirm the database exists in phpMyAdmin and if it doesn't

Dingo: If you received this error you need to make sure that the table you're trying to pull a list from
           actually exists. If you don't believe it does, or know it doesn't, add a new entry via the "Add..." tab
           and it should fix itself.
